# Snooze a Draft

### Description

**This setup enables you to „snooze“ drafts by sending them to the Reminders App and fetching them back when they are due.**

### Setup

1. Create a list in Reminders called „Export2Drafts“. 
💡*If you do not use Drafts for tasks, you might want to create a separate list to avoid mixing your snoozed drafts with your tasks in Reminder.*
2. Change the order of your lists in the Reminder app: the list, to which drafts are sent, should be on top. *(This can be changed in the Draft action.)*
3.

💡 *You can optionally duplicate the action and change the default due date to have multiple Snooze options.* 
7. Now you are ready to snooze any Draft. 
ℹ️ *Don’t forget that this setup only works while your iPhone is turned on at the time of fetching drafts back (Step 4). *
