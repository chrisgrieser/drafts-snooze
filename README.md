# Snooze a Draft

**This setup enables you to „snooze“ drafts by sending them to the Reminders App and fetching them back when they are due.**

---

**Step 1.** Create a list in Reminders called „Export2Drafts“. 

💡*If you do not use Drafts for tasks, you might want to create a separate list to avoid mixing your snoozed drafts with your tasks in Reminder.*

**Step 2.** Change the order of your lists in the Reminder app: the list, to which drafts are sent, should be on top. *(This can be changed in the Draft action.)* In the image below, drafts will be snoozed to the list 'do dates'.

**Step 6.** [Download the „Snooze“ Drafts Action.](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1lx)

💡 *You can optionally duplicate the action and change the default due date to have multiple Snooze options.* 

**Step 7.** Now you are ready to snooze any Draft. 

ℹ️ *Don’t forget that this setup only works while your iPhone is turned on at the time of fetching drafts back (Step 4).*
